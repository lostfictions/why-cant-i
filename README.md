updated documentation is wip. environment variables (required and optional) are
documented in [env.ts](src/env.ts).

to regenerate the disjoint git branch that the unused concept list is stored
in, make sure you're on a clone with the remote set correctly and that the file
`persist/unused_concepts.json` exists locally (you may have to run `yarn dev`).
then run `npx gh-pages -d persist -b data`.
